      <p><strong>I’m not going to say I can make you a 300-gamer but...</strong></p>
      <p>I am convinced that, regardless of the current state of your game, I 
        can share a secret that will improve your game.</p>
      <p>Who am I?   Well, I’m a bowler just like you.   I love the game.  I love getting  together with friends to bowl, I love the leagues, I love the sound of the ball  knocking down the pins.  I even like it  when they turn the lights off and the whole place goes fluoro on party nights.  </p>
      <p>When I first started bowling I wasn’t a terrible bowler, just a good, 
        solid performer averaging around 150 or so on a good day. But shortly 
        after I discovered what I'm about to share with you, my game shot up to 
        180 and improving - it made the world of difference to me.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Here's the story...</strong></p>
      <p>Many years ago, in what some might say was the classic age of American 
        bowling, bowler Frank Clause (bowling average 207) bought together 
        a handful of AMF champions, including eleven sanctioned 300 games. Through his experoience, he has shared his secrets in his, now legendary book, &quot;How To Win At Bowling&quot;.</p>

      <p>This book is the best I have seen with the secrets set out in an easy-to-read 
        straightforward way with pictures of every step! </p>
      <p><strong>Here's just a few things I learnt:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exactly the right size ball to  bowl for your height, weight and stance</li>
        <li>The three basic bowling stances  – one is exactly right for you</li>
        <li>Whether a three-step, four-step  or five-step approach is right for you – get this wrong and you arrive  unbalanced and unable to deliver the ball for your best results</li>
        <li>How to coordinate the backswing  and push-away so the ball travels as smoothly as a pendulum</li>
        <li>How far over the foul line to  deliver the ball, and how to release with the right hook for maximum pinfall</li>
        <li>Correct thumb and wrist  position at delivery – get this right and your ball will hook right into the  1-3 strike pocket more times than not</li>
        <li>How high your backswing should  be for correct balance and power</li>
        <li>Whether a straight, hook, curve  or backup delivery is best for you, and which delivery gives the most strikes  and highest scores (the experts were unanimous on this one!)</li>
        <li>Where to place your fingers at  the release of the ball for maximum control</li>
        <li>How to pick at least 20 pins a  game by converting two spare combinations you’ve been missing</li>
        <li>Diagrams to show how to attack  every possible combination of spares for maximum scoring</li>
        <li>Understand exactly where to aim  on the lane for your highest scoring opportunities</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Sounds good doesn't it? Here's the bottom line...</strong></p>
      <p>A decent bowling ball can cost anywhere up to $100 and beyond, but the 
        best ball in the alley is a waste of money without the skill to use it. 
        Since I love bowling so much, I am always on the lookout for information 
        to improve my game. As soon as I discovered this piece of work, I contacted 
        the author, and got permission to offer it online.<br />
        <br />
        It ended up costing me a little but I'm not looking to make money here, 
        just cover my costs. So I'd like to offer you a cheap copy of “How To Win At Bowling”. I know this book will improve your league scores, and will 
        have you enjoying your bowling more each day. Just knowing you have the 
        techniques you need to bowl a good game will improve your confidence enormously!</p>
