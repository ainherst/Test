<h3>ForeWord</h3>
<br></br>


<b>"Let's go bowling!" That's become the rallying cry of almost thirty million Americans throughout
 the United States who take their exercise in extremely palatable form: rolling a hard rubber ball 
down sixty feet of maple and pine toward ten standing pins. Today nearly everybody bowls—mother, dad,
 the kids—the whole family.
</b> Though bowling can trace its beginnings in this country to the time of the earliest colonists in
 Massachusetts, it wasn't until the last decade that the sport began to boom. A number of events triggered 
its rebirth. The first was the introduction, in 1952, of the American Machine & Foundry Company's Automatic
 Pinspotter—the remarkable device that resets the pins, announces which ones are knocked down and returns
 the ball—all automatically. By replacing the often un­reliable pinboy, it thereby made bowling an attractive
 in­vestment for the entrepreneur. Million dollar bowling centers began to spring up in every section of the country.<br />
<br />
   And people were waiting for these centers because another factor had whetted their appetite for the sport. That was television. 
The type of competition bowling offers lends itself remarkably well to TV. Scores and scores of locally originated television programs 
as well as several full network produc­tions introduced bowling to millions upon millions of Ameri­cans who had never been exposed to 
the fun of knocking down the stubborn tenpins.<br /><br />
   Today, nearly thirty million Americans bowl regularly. Of these, approximately ten million are women; one and a half million
 are children. And there are more than a million new bowlers who take up the sport each year.
<br /><br />

   Bowling knows no bounds; anyone, at any stage of life, can become its devotee. The handicapped, sometimes even the blind,
 find fun in the sport. It can be played at any time of the day or night, at any time of the year, and in every section of 
the country. No other sport qualifies as well for a claim to the title of "national pastime."

   <br></br>
   The author of this book, "Bowling Schoolmaster" Frank Clause, has been part and parcel of bowling's boom 
for the past five years, and has been a familiar figure on the bowling scene for the last two decades. He comes 
by his title—"The Bowling Schoolmaster"—quite naturally. Before becoming a professional star, he taught history
 and English for twenty-three years at the Old Forge High School in Pennsylvania. Today he is recognized as the
 best bowling instructor in the United States.
</b>
   <br></br>
   His syndicated column, "Tenpin Tips," appears in a long list of daily newspapers from coast to coast. He conducts
 "Free Bowling Clinics," slide programs, and the Bowling Primer for American Machine & Foundry Company through­out 
the year in every section of the country, traveling a quarter of a million miles each year in this endeavor. Instruc­tional
 motion pictures starring Mr. Clause are syndicated on television and circulated in schools. He serves, too, as the instructors' 
instructor in nationwide programs. Actually, his great talents as an instructor overshadow his bowling ac­complishments—and yet 
he holds a number of enviable records. A spot bowler, who uses a four-step approach, he holds a lifetime average of 207; and in
 the 1955-1956 season he ranked among the best in the nation, with a 224 season average.

   <br></br>
   Ever try for a perfect game? Well, Frank has eleven of them, all ABC sanctioned—a figure that ranks him third on the all-time 
listing of perfect-game bowlers.

   <br></br>
   <b>I Frank's greatest bowling exploits have been on television. In 1960 he became the sport's highest money winner, with some
 TV sharp-shooting which netted him more than $70,000. Twice he broke the jackpot on Milton Berle's "Jackpot Bowling" program to 
the delight of millions of televiewers, and the Internal Revenue Department. He cracked the first jackpot—for $26,000—on February
 12, and the second one for $41,000 on October 10. Other TV appearances as well as exhibition fees brought his income for 1960
 over the $100,000 mark—another record for the former $4,500-a-year schoolteacher.
</b>
   <br></br>
   Frank's newest project is a bowling center now being readied for opening in Boonton, New Jersey. 
It's a 24-lane establishment, all bright and modern, and designed to pro­vide fun for the whole family.

   <br></br>
   Though Frank Clause has been listed as a professional and a member of the Professional Bowlers 
Association for only the past five years, he has devoted the whole of his lifetime to the sport. As a 
teenager in Old Forge, and as a fledgling teacher, he bowled.

	<br></br>
    Writing a bowling book "has always been one of my ambitions," declares Frank. His prescription for 
success in bowling, he feels, should be promulgated to as many people as possible. Not only will it help 
you get the very most pins, but it will lead to the greatest enjoyment you can derive from the sport. His 
one basic guiding rule is this: be yourself, be natural. Whether on your delivery, in your approach, in your
 follow-through, or simply in the way you pick up the ball, Frank Clause says: be yourself, be natural. Now 
with that in mind, you're ready for some instruction of a more specific nature.

    <br></br>
	Good luck, and good bowling!

    <br></br>
