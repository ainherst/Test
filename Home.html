<h4>They Laughed When I Said I Wanted To Bowl, But When I Bowled 7 Strikes In a Row?</h4>
<br></br>

<p><img id="grahm" img src="014.jpg">
<b>From The Desk Of:</b> Graham McAllister<br /><br />
   Dear Friend,<br /><br />
   Since you’ve found this website I suppose it’s OK to let you know…
   “I really want to be able to play bowls like a pro.” The truth is, 
   I’m always on the internet looking for the latest secrets on how to 
   bowl and win with all the tricks of the pros. That’s what led me to 
   put this website up. Let me explain…<br /><br />

   While surfing around the internet, I stumbled upon something so fantastic 
   that it immediately got my attention… In fact, I discovered something sooo 
   amazing that at first I thought it was "too good to be true" like most 
   things are.
   <br></br>
   You see, a few months ago, I was actually doing some research on Frank Clause,
   one of the most well known and respected bowlers in recent history. I noticed
   that most of his work was available and accounted for with the exception of one
   of his most <b>important pieces of work ‘How To Win At Bowling’.</b>
   <br></br>
   Well, this got me curious and so I started digging a little deeper. I started 
   sending off a few emails asking questions, but unfortunately every road I seemed 
   to head down was a dead end… until a couple of weeks ago that is… 
   <br></br>
   By a stroke of luck, I emailed my story to one of my favorite site’s webmasters… 
   as it turned out he had an old copy of this difficult to find book - it was right
   under my damn nose. After numerous emails, I finally got him to mail me his copy.
   <br></br>
   <b>I Uncovered One Of The Most Important Bowling Manuscripts Of All Time....</b>
   <br></br>
   Even though it was first published in 1961 this book has the best bowling 
   information I have ever seen.
   <br></br>
   In the 15 chapters here’s just a snippet of what you’ll learn:
   <ul>
      <li><b>The basic regulations</b>-there are certain regulations that you must follow,
	  to be able to play legally. You must follow these regulations if you want to 
	  play ‘bowls’.</li>
	  <br></br>
	  <li><b>What the bowling fundamentals</b> are—learn what the fundamentals are for playing
	  bowls. You have to learn these first..</li>
	  <br></br>
	  <li><b>The Fit of the ball and what it means</b>—learn how to get the best fitting ball for 
	  your hand. You’ll be shown how to get the best fitting ball so you can play to your
	  optimum performance.</li>
	  <br></br>
	  <li><b>What shoes and bag you’ll need</b>—discover what shoes you’ll need and the best bag to use
	  to protect your balls.</li>
	  <br></br>
	  <li><b>Tips & tricks on how to start</b> and how to stand properly—if you don’t get this right, 
	  then you won’t be bowling very good. Learn this and you’ll be unstoppable.</li>
	  <br></br>
	  <li><b>How to hold the ball</b>—you might think this is easy, but the reality is there is a correct 
	  way to hold the ball, to make delivering the ball more smooth and get more control.</li>
	</ul>
	<br></br>
    And there’s loads more…
    <br></br>
	At this point, you might be wondering how you can get your hands on a copy…
    <br></br>
	Well here’s the good news.
    <br></br>
	After doing even more research (I told you I was totally mad about learning how to bowl) 
	I have contacted the original copyright owners and gained permission to republish Frank 
	Clause's complete work on this website.
    <br></br>
	Bowling is my passion and I want to share it with as many people as possible. Believe 
	it or not, I’ve decided to do something completely unheard of these days. I’m going to 
	let you have this amazing manuscript for nothing.
	<br></br>
	<b>It’s FREE… Yes 100% FREE</b>
    <br></br>
	Now you have no excuse for not being able to bowl like the best of them who pride themselves 
	as the best bowlers in your town.
